## Yellow Rose ##

Yellow Rose is a VST audio plugin that takes an audio file input (.mp3, .wav) and allows the user to change the sample by
 controlling a unique time skipping algorithm, as well as controls over the ADSR (attack, decay, sustain, release) of the sample.
 The time skipping algorithm has two parameters: a chop amount and a chop frequency. The chop amount controls how far
 forward/backward the sample should skip, and the chop frequency controls how often this skip occurs. For example, a chop amount
 of 1 second and a frequency of 0.5 seconds means that every half second, the sample skips forward by 1 second. One more example
 would be a chop amount of -5ms and a frequency of 10ms, which means every 10ms, the sample goes backwards 5ms, effectively doubling
 the length of the sample while giving it an interesting auditory texture.
